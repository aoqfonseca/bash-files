# My Shell files

This repo is where I save some of util shell (bash files) 


I'm currently using the ZSH as prompt, then I have my customized .zshrc
Other than this, I have some scripts with customizations and helpers functions 


In order to customize my tmux session and use the tpm (tmux plugin manager), we should clone the repo: 
`https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm`

In that repo, follow README install instruction
